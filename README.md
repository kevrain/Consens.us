# Consens.us

**Consens.us** is an app that allows you to create groups of your friends from Facebook, and from there that group can each propose an "event"
they would like to do. Each person in the group can then vote on the event they would prefer do or attend. Additionally, voting can be further
broken down into preferred dates or times.
